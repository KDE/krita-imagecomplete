This plugin implements basic Poisson Image Completion. Query google for "Poisson Image Completion" for more details.

To use: 
1) Open a image file in krita.
2) Select the regions which you want to fill.
3) Run the plugin and it'll fill in the selected regions.
4) It works very well when trying to remove text from an image.
